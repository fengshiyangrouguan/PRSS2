def solve(**kwargs):
    """
    Solve the one-dimensional bin packing problem for a single test case.

    Input kwargs (for a single test case):
      - id:           The problem identifier (string)
      - bin_capacity: The capacity of each bin (int)
      - num_items:    The number of items (int)
      - items:        A list of item sizes (list of ints)
      - **kwargs:     Other unused keyword arguments

    Evaluation metric:
      - The solution is scored by the total number of bins used.
      - If the solution is invalid (e.g., items are missing or duplicated, or bin capacity is exceeded),
        a penalty of 1,000,000 is added.

    Returns:
      A dictionary with:
        - 'num_bins': An integer, the number of bins used.
        - 'bins': A list of lists, where each inner list contains the 1-based indices of items assigned to that bin.

    Note: This is a placeholder implementation.
